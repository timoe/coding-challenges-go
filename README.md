# Coding challenges, solved in GoLang

This repository contains my solutions to common coding challenges e.g. found on Hackerrank, Leetcode and others. 
I do this for fun. And for keeping my thinking flexible. This, as, in my experience, I don't solve problem like this (but mostly wiring one library with another). 

Challenges are solved in Golang. It helps to have defined problems when I'm exploring programming languages. 
`+` Go, from my point of view, does a lot of things right where lots of other languages fail.

## Challenges

- [Clone a graph](clone-graph/clone-graph.md)
- [Two sum](two-sum/twosum.md)
- [Queues](queue/queue.md)
- [Sum two lists](add-two-nums/two-nums-from-list.md)
- [Median of two sorted arrays](median-sorted-array/median-sorted-array.md)
