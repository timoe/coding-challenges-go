# Add numbers from two lists

Given are two lists representing an inversed number (to base 10).

`[2, 4, 3]` representing `342` and `[5, 6, 4]` representing `465`

These two numbers should be summed up and returned as a list with a reverse representation of the result.
`465 + 342 = 807 resulting list is [7, 0, 8]`

My solution is at [add-two-nums.go](add-two-nums.go)
